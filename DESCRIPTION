Package: sfnetworks
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Title: Creating and Analyzing Spatial Networks
Description: Creates a spatial network of class sfn_networks out of either an 
    sf object with linestring geometry, a SpatialLinesDataFrame or an osmdata 
    object. The package contains functions to calculate shortest pathes between 
    nodes in the network and to transform or convert its coordinate reference 
    systems. Also, it includes a function to convert the spatial network to an
    igraph object, after which all kinds of graph analyses can be performed on 
    the network. Finally, the spatial network can be visualized in several ways, 
    both statically and interactively.
