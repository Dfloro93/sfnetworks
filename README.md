The new sfnetworks package
================

The `sfnetworks` package is currently under active development, and breaking changes will be made in the coming months. The current master branch is released as `v0.1.0`, but will soon be succeeded by a new version, with different classes and functions. These classes and functions are developed in the develop branch, which you are currently viewing. Feel free to already open issues containing ideas of what functionalities you think should be included in the new package version (please use the `feature` issue template for this).
